# Supporting Data for Alchemical Simulations

This repository contains supporting data associated with the paperâ€™s alchemical simulations.

## Repository Structure

- **Mutation folders (A7S..Y21X6)**  
  Contain topologies and initial/final structures for amino acid mutations in both free and complex states.

- **`charmm.ff/`**  
  Includes force field files for non-standard amino acid mutations.  
  For standard amino acid mutations, please refer to: [pmx mutation forcefields](http://pmx.mpibpc.mpg.de/mutff45.tar.gz)

- **`MD_MDPs/`**  
  Contains MD parameter files used in the alchemical simulations.
